# InTown
If you are new to a city/town and want to see what is happening around, but do not want to scout through different websites, then just use http://intown.space

This repository is the source code that runs the website above. The software is released as Open Source and you are welcome to contribute to it.

## History
This project was started at HackathonHH by a group of seven folks. Having worked on the project over 24 hours of the weekend, the group decided to continue working on the project after the hackthon. It was also decided to keep all source code under an Open Source license. There is a Trello board to help manage the development and marketing of the project.

## Usage
To get this running, add your own API keys. Instructions to run this will come shortly.
